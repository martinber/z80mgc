z80 minimal game console

Clock speed
-----------

- RAM is 71256 SA25TPG. Therefore is 25ns access time: Data is valid 25ns after OE and CS are set.
- RAM is 28C64 25P. Therefore I think it is 250ns access time: Data is valid 250ns after OE and CS are set.
- CPU is Z84C0006TPG. Therefore is 6.17MHz, equivalent to 166ns per clock. It waits memory for 2
  clock cycles (this time is shortened a bit because of the logic gates I use to select memory).
- LCD takes 1.6ms for clearing and 72 Âµs (72000ns) for each of the other instructions. So I can do
  around 13800 instructions per second. When writing make the E pulse at least 160ns long (CPU does
  this for around 2 clock cycles) and leave the data for 20ns after disabling (CPU does this for
  around half a clock cycle). When reading, data is valid 260ns after enabled (CPU waits for around
  2 clock cycles)
- Logic gates have around 10ns propagation time.
- The nake game was doing around 150 instructions per game loop. If I consider 4 clocks per
  instruction, I can run it at 60fps if the clock is at around 36kHz?

So apparently I can run at full clock speed, where I would be close to reaching the limit of LCD
read times. I have to wait LCD after each instruction.
